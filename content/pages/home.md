My research interests lie in the general area of high-performance computing, particularly in parallel programming and algorithms, with the focus on graph algorithms and applied numerical linear algebra.

I am a third-year EECS Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advisded by Prof. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/">Jim Demmel</a>. During my first two years, I was also co-advised by Dr. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/">Aydın Buluç</a>.
